In Dart

Normal class act as interface.

To make a class acts as interface use implements

Example

class Remote{

}

class SamsungRemote implements Remote{

}

If we use class as interface then we have to override all the property and methods of that class.

You can implements multiple class

class Student implements Person,Captain{

}
